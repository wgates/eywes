            <h1>Knockaround</h1>
            <p>Knockaround is the original, affordable sunglasses company. 
            Founded in 2005, Knockaround offers a variety of frame styles 
            that are both practical and stylish. Our motto is simple; 
            “Quality Shades That Won’t Break the Bank”.</p>

        <p>I’ve been at Knockaround for six years, so if I were to lay out every major project win we’ve had in that time this 
        might end up being the longest page on the internet. 
        Instead, I’d like to post a few major challenges in those six years and how we tackled them.</p>

        <h2>Magento to Shopify Migration</h2>

        <p>In the summer of 2016 we decided that Magento was no longer an option as a platform for our business. 
        Increasing licensing and server/hosting costs coupled with an incredibly messy dysfunctional codebase being the main factors. 
        After a few weeks of research and planning, we landed on Shopify Plus – a no brainer.</p>

        <div class="casestudy-focus">
          <p><b>Magento Costs:</b> $3,500k/mo license, $2k/mo hosting and server fees<br />
            <b>Shopify Plus costs:</b> $2k/mo
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>Moving thousands of customer, order, and product records isn’t easy. We were very fortunate that Shopify 
        had partnered with <a href="https://www.nchannel.com" target="_blank">nChannel</a> to handle Magento —> Shopify data transfer for us. Our products, 
        order history, customer database, and sales reports were all seamlessly moved from one platform to the other. 
        The process went smoothly, and we had our data successfully transferred in a few weeks time.</p>

        <h2>Custom Sunglasses Shop</h2>
        <p>At Knockaround we all feel the thing that differentiates us from other sunglasses brands is our Custom Shop. 
        From only $30 you can create your own unique pair of shades, with over 1 million possible combinations. 
        When we moved to Shopify in 2017 we built a custom solution for our Custom Shop as the app store didn’t 
        offer what we needed.</p>

        <p>Three years later it became apparent it was time for an upgrade. Requirements: Built in Vue or React, 
        used Storefront API, and had rock-solid support. A few weeks later we found our match, 
        <a href="https://www.rehash.com/assembly" target="_blank">Assembly</a>, built by the team at Rehash 
        (now part of <a href="https://pixelunion.net" target="_blank">Pixel Union</a>).</p>

        <img src="/assets/case-studies/custom-shop-knockaround-sunglasses.jpg" alt="knockaround custom sunglasses design" />

        <p>Our timeline was extremely tight, almost unfeasible, at a mere 1.5 months so we could launch before BF/CM. 
        The team at Rehash knocked it well out of the park. Our Custom Shop is faster, easier to manage, and provides 
        a better experience than ever before. If your brand is looking for a custom product solution and you’re 
        a Shopify Plus customer, I can’t recommend Assembly enough.</p>

        <p>Our custom shop currently has over <i>1,000,000</i> possible combinations! Not only is it a joy to play around with, 
        it’s also a fantastic product for customers who wan’t their own unique pair of sunglasses.

        <h2>Redesign Implementations</h2>

        <p>Over the years we’ve consistently iterated on creating an experience for customers through design 
        that matches the underlying feeling of Knockaround. Bright, colorful, fun, outgoing.</p>

        <p>Originally, our philosophy was let the sunglasses be the drops of color on the page. 
        The introduction of color into other parts of our design has created a much more pleasant experience.</p>

        <img src="/assets/case-studies/oldvsnew-design.jpg" alt="old vs new designs layered mobile" />

        <p>During each redesign I build these templates out keeping in mind marketing will be adjusting and 
        rotating content during design refreshes and product launches. Thanks to Shopify sections, 
        I’m able to create completely customizable blocks of content that the marketing team can 
        update themselves with no deployments needed.</p>

        <p>Where sections aren’t the most optimal solution, Shopify’s metafields are a great solution 
        for creating logic that your internal teams can utilize to easily customize templates.</p>

        <p><b>Example:</b> Our special release product use a custom template that is much more customized than the 
        regular product page. Custom heads, texts, body images, etc. In order for this content to 
        be unique per-page, I use <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/accentuate" target="_blank">Accentuate Custom Fields</a> to create blocks that are tied to the product 
        that is being edited. Specifically, this section is a graphic design with the release pair and a 
        paragraph blurb describing the release.</p>

        <p>First, I created the metafields in the app and set up the appropriate type.</p>

        <img src="/assets/case-studies/accentuate-custom-fields.jpg" alt="accentuate custom fields app" />

        <p>Then in the template you can reference the metafield’s unique ID to grab the generated variable that will 
        display the content on the page:</p>

        <img src="/assets/case-studies/code-example.jpg" alt="code reference to accentuate custom fields" />

        <p>After styling those elements you’ll be able to upload content that will be unique to that 
        specific product, and won’t need to create a new section file to accomplish this.</p>

        <img src="/assets/case-studies/knockaround-shark-week.jpg" alt="knockaround shark week accentuate custom fields example" />

        <p>Working for Knockaround has been a dream. I look forward to future projects and growth with the company 
        that I'm lucky enough to be a part of.</p>
