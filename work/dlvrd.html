  <p>After working with Lume Cube to build their marketplace presence, DLVRD’s work was recognized in a 
  People magazine article. To showcase the success, DLVRD came to me to design and develop their case study page.</p>

  <div class="casestudy-focus">
    <p><b>Requirements:</b> Highlight the client wins in an easily digestible format, provide the challenges of 
    the project and tactics used to tackle those challenges, showcase the results and press, and finally, show the 
    testimonial from the client.
    </p>
  </div>

  more and more project wins as their business grows. If your business is in need of an agency willing to go the
