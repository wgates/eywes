        <h1>KNINE Coffee & Strength</h1>
        <p>KNINE Coffee & Strength is a Redlands based company that fulfills the caffeine needs of many and 
        donates 9% of their revenue to help animals in need.</p>

    <p>KNINE Coffee & Strength encompasses millennial’s three favorite things: coffee, gym, and dogs. 
    So, when they approached me to help build an Shopify e-commerce store for their brand, 
    naturally the answer was an immediate yes.</p>

    <p>KNINE’s website was designed in Figma, a fantastic free tool for designing anything you could think of. 
    Figma provides a share URL that allows for the client to leave feedback on designs. Albeit a bit creepy, 
    you can also track their mouse position as they view your design.</p>

    <p>KNINE requested the ability for customers to order "coffee subscriptions". A simple and effective 
    way to allow people to receive a monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly bag of coffee without having to place 
    manual orders. To accomplish this we went with Recharge, a built-for-Shopify app that allows you to create 
    custom subscription models and automatically creates new subscription products based off of the product 
    you select to eligible for reoccurring orders.</p>
    
    <p>Recharge saves the customers payment info, and created orders 
    in Shopify based on the date their order was placed and the subscription interval they selected. Out of the box, 
    the app did exactly what we needed with zero fuss.</p>

    <p>KNINE successfully created a marketing campaign to build hype for the launch utilizing social media and 
    a Klaviyo email list that was embedded as a form into the site’s landing countdown page. When the launch weekend 
    was over, they had <b>113</b> orders placed and a final sales total of <b>$5,741.95</b>. An incredible outcome.</p>
